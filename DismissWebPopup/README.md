# Dismiss a Browser Popup
Using Selenium to automate a web site is a very powerful tool when interacting with the UI elements of the app. 
However, when you need to interact with elements that appear on the screen but are not part of the app, Selenium may not provide the answer. 
A classic example is a popup generated by the browser that asks a question like - should the password be remembered, or should your location be revealed.
For these situations Perfecto provides its visual analysis tools.

This sample script activates the Yahoo weather website, requests the local weather, and uses the Perfecto _text:select_ command to identify the popup's button and click it to dismiss the popup.
