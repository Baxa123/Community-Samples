#EspressoAPK sample code

**Purpose** - This sample contains two projects:
- _simpNotes_ - Android Studio project that includes a simple Notes application and Espresso test cases that test various aspects of the application UI.
- _EspressoEx_ - Intellij gradle project that includes a Selenium RWD test script that connects to a Perfecto Lab device and then executes the Espresso tests on the device, using the **_espressoExecute_** Perfecto command.

**Special Notes on Sample files**

+ The folder _simpNotes/outputs_ contains the two .apk files used to upload to Repository. Normally these would be generated by gradle and be generated in _simpNotes/app/build/outputs_.
+ The _build.gradle_ file in _EspressoEx_ applies the **_application_** plugin (see lines 5-6 of the file) to support the **run** task of gradle.
+ This code sample is intended to be used together with the Jenkins project described in the [community article](https://community.perfectomobile.com/groups/30292/posts/1254777)
