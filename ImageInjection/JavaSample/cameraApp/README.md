## Sample Overview

Sample is Appium script that installs an application that uses the device camera to scan an item. We use Perfecto's Image Injection to supply an image. Verify that image is displayed with visual checkpoint.

The application is instrumented for the image injection, using the Perfecto Appium capability - **cameraInstrument** set to _true_.
