# Reading External .xml File in Java #

This is a sample code in java for reading external xml file.
This is useful for when you have a lot of data to use in your script and instead of hard-coding it in the script, 
you can read it from an external data table in xml format. 
The implementaion used here to parse the xml is DOM parser, which comes with the JDK, so no third pary libraries are needed.
