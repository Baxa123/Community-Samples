This is the sample project for [this community article] (https://community.perfectomobile.com/posts/1223970)

In some cases it may be interesting to see how certain parts of an application perform over time. This can be done by adding timers to a test, which is scheduled to run every x minutes.
This simple Maven based tool will help gather the timers from each executed run in an Excel file, removing the need to do this manually.
This enables users to quickly pinpoint inconsistent test runs, and dive into video and report.
